This is the repository for the [Sigma-9 theme](https://scpwiki.com/component:theme), the default CSS used to style the [SCP Wiki](http://www.scpwiki.com). It was originally created by [Aelanna](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna) and is presently maintained by the SCP Wiki Technical Team.

This theme is available under the wiki's [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license (CC-BY-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

Upon merging or pushing to the `main` branch, CSS will be deployed to [GitHub Pages](https://scpwiki.github.io/sigma9/) so the artifacts can be used by the theme in production.
