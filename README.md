## Sigma-9

This is the repository for the Sigma-9 theme, the default CSS used to style the [SCP Wiki](http://www.scp-wiki.net). It was originally created by [Aelanna](http://www.wikidot.com/user:info/aelanna) and is presently maintained by the SCP Wiki Technical Team.

This theme is available under the wiki's [Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 license (CC-BY-SA)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/).

### Updating the Theme

When new changes are pushed to the repository, they are not automatically reflected in the mainsite. You must open the page [`component:theme`](http://www.scp-wiki.net/component:theme), and copy the CSS from `sigma9.css` into the `[[code]]` block.

Contrary to legend, it is not necessary to "re-select" the CSS source in the wiki's administrative panel. Updating the code block is sufficient.
